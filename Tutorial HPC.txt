][ HPC TUTORIAL ][

------------------

HOW DO I OPEN THE IRIS CLUSTER ?
Run a terminal (Linux directly or WSL)
input the following command to start access the HPC cluster:
ssh iris-cluster (doens't matter from which directory you call, enter credentials, type "exit" to close the cluster)
--Screenshot IRIS CLUSTER--

HOW DOES IT WORK ?
From there it is like in linux, the commands are available.
ls (looks for files in current directory)
cd <directory> (Takes you to specified directory)
vim <filename> (create or modify file)
rm <filename> (remove file)
cat <filename> (prints content of the file in the terminal)
mv <filename1> <filename2> (moves file)
...

HOW DO I MAKE A SESSION ON A NODE ?
WARNING - First you must use a command to open a node session for a specific duration
si -t 2:00:00 -N1 -c 28 --reservation=opti_project (Reserves 1 node [N1] for 2 hours [-t] with 28 cores [-c] for specific reservation opti_project) {here we do 28 to reserve the entire node and ensure that nobody runs other stuff on the node while we are trying to measure energy costs}
--screenshot after allocationg the terminal cd shows something else--

OPTIONAL WAYS TO RUN JOBS
srun (like si but to start a job and you have to specify all the args yourself)
sbatch (more later)

HOW DO I SEE WHO IS CURRENTLY USING OUR PROJECT'S NODE ?
