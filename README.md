# OCS_Project
This is the source code for the project of Elliot, Xavier and Gabriel. (In the context of OCS course)

Files matrix_op.c and matrix_op.cpp are still under work. That is the code taken from examples to try to understand how to make it work.

Files matrix_op.py and matrix_op_np.py are two implementations using python, one by applying the mathematical definition and the other one with numpy. The numpy is there more for testing the energy consumption of using already existing implementation.

Files matrix_op.js and matrix_op_mathjs.js are javascript implementation, the second one uses the mathjs library.
