# OCS_Project
This repository contains the report and all the code related to the group project made by Gabriel SPADONI, Elliot KOCH and Xavier-Robert FRANÃ‡OIS under the supervision of Emmanuel Kieffer and Tobias FISCHBACH for the course "Optimisation for Computer Science" of the second semester of the Master in Computer Science at the University of Luxembourg.

## HPC folder contains a more advanced readme.txt

Files matrix_op.c and matrix_op.cpp are still under work. That is the code taken from examples to try to understand how to make it work.

Files matrix_op.py and matrix_op_np.py are two implementations using python, one by applying the mathematical definition and the other one with numpy. The numpy is there more for testing the energy consumption of using already existing implementation.

Files matrix_op.js and matrix_op_mathjs.js are javascript implementation, the second one uses the mathjs library.
